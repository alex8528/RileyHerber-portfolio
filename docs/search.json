    "text": "Hello! My name is Riley Herber, and I am a Bioinformatics Master’s student at the University of Georgia. I graduated from UGA with a BS in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and enrolled into the Double Dawgs program.\n\n\nWhile I am not currently in a research lab, I have past experience working under other Bioinformatics PhD students. I have experience with other programming languages such as:\n\nMATLAB\nC++\nPython\n\nI have basic data analysis and modeling experience with these languages.\n\n\n\nI will be taking BIOS7010 alongside this course, but have taken Statistical Inference for the Life Sciences (BINF 8441) in the past, which introduced statistical topics such as probability, maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, linear regression, etc.\n\n\n\nI hope to learn how to adequately design and use effective data analysis workflows. I want to gain hands-on experience with a variety of analytical methods that will help me approach future research questions and real-world problems with confidence. I am currently unfamiliar with Positron and Quarto, so I am especially excited to expand my technical skill set by learning these tools, along with others we will explore throughout the semester.\n\n\n\nClimate Spiral Visualization\nThis website provides a cool example of how data analysis and visualization is important, while being very visually engaging and impactful. This animation shows how global temperatures have changed over time, using a spiral that expands outward as the Earth warms. It’s a great example of how data analysis can be turned into a visual story and then communicated to the audience."

In both plots, especially the second one, you will see ‘streaks’ of data that seem to go together. Can you figure out what is going on here?\nThe “streaks” in the plots likely represent individual countries observed across multiple years. Because africadata contains statistics for infant mortality and population for the same countries across different years, multiple observations from each country appear in the plots. Since these values typically change gradually over time within a country, the data points remain close together, forming visible “streaks.”\nMore Data Processing\n\n#figures out which years have missing data for infant mortality\ntapply(africadata$infant_mortality, africadata$year, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))\n\n1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 \n  10   17   16   16   15   14   13   11   11    7    5    6    6    6    5    5 \n1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 \n   3    3    2    2    1    1    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0 \n1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 \n   0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0 \n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 \n   0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0   51 \n\n#the tapply function applies a funciton to a set vectors\n#tapply is applying the function sum(is.na(x)) to the groups africadata$infant_mortality and africadata$year\n#the sum() function takes the sum/total of a group\n#the is.na() function checks each value in a dataframe/group is NA or not\n#so sum(is.na(x) returns the total amount of NA values in each year\n\n#Creates a new object by extracting only the data for the year 2000 from the africadata object\nafrica_2000 &lt;- africadata[africadata$year == \"2000\",]\n\nMore Plotting\n\n#Plotting life expectancy as a function of infant mortality for year 2000\n#using the plot function to make the plot and assigning it to a variable named \"plot3\"\nplot3 &lt;- plot( \n\n  #takes the infant_mortality column from africa_2000 and makes it the x-axis values\n  africa_2000$infant_mortality,\n\n  #takes the life expactancy column from africa_2000 and makes it the y-axis values\n  africa_2000$life_expectancy,\n    \n  xlab = \"Life Expectancy\", #labels the x-axis \"Life Expectancy\"\n  ylab = \"Infant Mortality\", #labels the y-axis \"Infant Mortality\"\n\n  #titles the whole plot \"Infant Mortality vs Life Expectancy in Africa in 2000\"\n  main = \"Infant Mortality vs Life Expectancy in Africa in 2000\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Plotting life expectancy as a function of population\n#using the plot function to make the plot and assigning it to a variable named \"plot4\"\nplot4 &lt;- plot( \n\n  #takes the population column from africa_2000 and makes it the x-axis values \n  africa_2000$population, \n\n  #takes the life expactancy column from africa_2000 and makes it the y-axis values\n  africa_2000$life_expectancy, \n    \n  xlab = \"Life Expectancy\", #labels the x-axis \"Life Expectancy\"\n  ylab = \"Population\", #labels the y-axis \"Population\"\n\n  #titles the whole plot \"Population vs Life Expectancy in Africa in 2000\"\n  main = \"Population vs Life Expectancy in Africa in 2000\", \n    \n  log = \"x\" #sets the scale of the x-axis to be logarithmic\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Model Fits\n\n# fit1 models life expectancy as a function of infant mortality for African countries in 2000.\n#the lm() function is used to fit linear models\nfit1 &lt;- lm(life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = africa_2000)\nsummary(fit1) #prints results of fir1\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = africa_2000)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-22.6651  -3.7087   0.9914   4.0408   8.6817 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

Based on the slope, each additional infant death per 1,000 live births is associated with a decrease of approximately 0.19 years in life expectancy. When infant mortality is theoretically zero, predicted life expectancy is about 71.3 years. R squared = 0.47 means about 47% of the variability in life expectancy is explained by infant mortality.\n\n# fit2 models life expectancy as a function of population for African countries in 2000.\nfit2 &lt;- lm(life_expectancy ~ population, data = africa_2000)\nsummary(fit2) #prints results of fir1\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = life_expectancy ~ population, data = africa_2000)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-18.429  -4.602  -2.568   3.800  18.802 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.
